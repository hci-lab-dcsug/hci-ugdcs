    title: "A Chatbot for Maternal Care in Akan",
    description:
      "This project focuses on the development of a sophisticated chatbot designed to support maternal care, encompassing both prenatal and postnatal needs. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs),\
         the chatbot provides mothers and caregivers with personalized advice, vital health information, and actionable tips in their native languages. Recognizing the linguistic diversity of underserved communities, \
         this initiative seeks to break down language barriers by supporting low-resource languages such as Twi, Fante, Dagbani, Baoule, Ga, Ikposo, and Dagaare. \
         The overarching goal of the project is to make healthcare more accessible to communities that often lack adequate resources and infrastructure. \
         By addressing critical maternal care needs and providing an easily accessible, multilingual platform, this initiative empowers women and families in underserved areas. It strives to reduce disparities in maternal health outcomes and ensure that essential care reaches even the most remote regions. Ultimately, this project aims to promote inclusivity and equity in healthcare by expanding its reach to diverse linguistic and cultural groups.",

    title: "Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Standard Akan Speech",
    description:
      "This project addresses the challenge of creating robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for non-standard Akan speech,\
        a language spoken in various dialects across Ghana and neighboring regions. By leveraging state-of-the-art ASR models such as Whisper,\
        the initiative seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recognizing and transcribing spoken Akan in its diverse forms.\
        The primary goal of this work is to enhance accessibility and bridge the gap between technology and underserved communities that rely \
        on low-resource languages. Developing ASR systems capable of understanding non-standard speech patterns will enable seamless communication with technology,\
        opening up opportunities for education, healthcare, and other essential services. Through this project, the team aspires to empower speakers of Akan and similar low-resource languages by providing them with tools \
        that respect and preserve their linguistic identities while reducing communication barriers. By focusing on technological inclusivity, \
        this initiative seeks to create a more equitable digital future for underserved communities.",
